        I have been working in the tech world, from lead generation to tech
        sales, for about 15 years.
        <p></p>
        After attending Drexel University, I fell into the technology industry
        and never looked back.
        <p></p>
        My first job in lead generation lead me to my first tech company
        position with Commscope/Ruckus Wireless. I then took positions at
        Axcient and Druva, both working in the cloud backup field.
