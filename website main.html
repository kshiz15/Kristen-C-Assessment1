        I have been working in the tech world, from lead generation to tech
        sales, for about 15 years.
        <p></p>
        After attending Drexel University, I fell into the technology industry
        and never looked back.
        <p></p>
        My first job in lead generation led me to my first tech company position
        with Commscope/Ruckus Wireless. I then took positions at Axcient and
        Druva, both working in the cloud backup field.
